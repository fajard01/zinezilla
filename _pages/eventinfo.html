        Zinezilla, Bristol’s kaiju-inspired art event, is back and bigger than ever!

Bringing together marketplace, animation festival and workshop space, Gordon The Godzilla and his friends will be taking over the Trinity Centre for a full day of festivities, activities and art. 

Zinezilla is bringing you a full market hall of independent creators -

come along for comics, prints, zines, books, stickers, merch, ceramics and more!

Upstairs we’ll have our workshop space for a full day of interactive talks and

workshops so you can get stuck in and involved.

And Animinspo will be hosting an animation festival featuring the interviews and panels

to choose from.

We will be announcing the full programme closer to the time.

Tickets are £3, on Headfirst or on the door, which gets you entry to everything and a raffle ticket.

Applications for tables at Zinezilla will be open 10th March to 20th April.

Applications to screen a film at Animinspo’s animation screenings will be open via Animinspo.

Please visit www.animinspo.com or Animinspo on Instagram for more info.
